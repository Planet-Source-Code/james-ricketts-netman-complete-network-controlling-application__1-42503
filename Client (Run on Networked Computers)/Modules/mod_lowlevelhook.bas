Attribute VB_Name = "mod_lowlevelhook"
''''For Windows NT SP3 (or higher), Microsoft introduced a new hook: WH_KEYBOARD_LL. This hook is called the low-level hook because it is notified of keystrokes just after the user enters them and before the system gets a chance to process them. This hook has a serious drawback: the thread processing the hook filter function could enter an infinite loop or hang. If this happens, then the system will no longer process keystrokes properly and the user will become incredibly frustrated. To alleviate this situation, Microsoft places a time limit on low-level hooks. When the system sends a notification to a low-level keyboard hookâ€™s filter function, the system allows that function a fixed amount of time to execute. If the function does not return in the allotted time, the system ignores the hook filter function and processes the keystroke normally. The amount of time allowed (in milliseconds) is set via the LowLevelHooksTimeout value under the following registry subkey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop.
''''The program (VB) is disabling some of these combinations (ALT-TAB, CTRL-ESC and ALT-ESC) as long as the option is checked.
